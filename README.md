Project Title: Bookstore Management System
Objective: Develop a full-featured RESTful API for a bookstore management
system that can later integrate seamlessly with a front-end application.
Features:
1. User Authentication and Profiles
- Sign Up: Users can register using their email, password, and name. Validate
email uniqueness.
- Sign In: Authenticate users and provide JWT on successful sign-in.
- Profile: Authenticated users can view and update their profiles.
2. Books CRUD with Advanced Features
- Basic CRUD: As previously mentioned.
- Book Reviews: Authenticated users can leave reviews and ratings for books.
- Search & Filter: Allow users to search books by title or author and filter by
ratings.
3. Shopping Cart
- Authenticated users can add books to their cart, update the quantity, or remove
books from the cart.
- View cart contents, with book details and total price.
4. Error Handling and Validation
- Comprehensive error handling for all routes.
- Input validation for all API endpoints using libraries like `jo`i or
`express-validator`.
Detailed Steps:
1. Set Up & Database Integration
- Initialize Node.js project and install necessary packages.
- Connect to MongoDB and define User, Book, and Cart schemas and models
using Mongoose.
2. User Authentication and Profile Management
- Create routes for registration, login, and user profile management.
- Implement password hashing using libraries like `bcryp`t.
- Secure routes using JWT middleware.
3. Books CRUD & Advanced Features
- Implement routes for book CRUD operations.
- Develop endpoints for adding reviews to books. Each review should contain a
comment and a rating (1-5 stars).
- Implement a search and filter mechanism for books.
4. Shopping Cart Functionality
- Create routes for adding books to cart, updating quantity, viewing the cart, and
deleting books from the cart.
- Calculate the total price for the books in the cart.
5. Error Handling & Input Validation
- Handle common errors like missing routes, invalid inputs, and unauthorized
access.
- Validate all user inputs to prevent malicious or unintended requests.
6. Testing & Documentation
- Test all routes with Postman or similar tools.
- Document each API endpoint, detailing request methods, parameters, and
expected responses.
Evaluation Criteria (Expanded):
1. Functional Completeness
- Ensure all the described features are implemented and working as expected.
2. Integration Readiness
- API should be designed in a way that makes it easy to integrate with a front-end
application. Consider practices like CORS setup for cross-origin requests.
3. Security
- Proper use of password hashing and secure JWT implementation.
- Validation of user inputs to prevent potential attacks.
4. Code and Database Design
- Efficient and organized code structure.
- Proper schema design ensuring data integrity and optimized queries.
5. Testing and Documentation
- Comprehensive testing of each route.
- Detailed documentation for future developers or teams.

Remember, all the routes except for Sign Up and Sign In should have JWT
middleware for user authentication. This will ensure that only authenticated users
can access those routes.
This is a high-level design, and the actual implementation might require more
detailed responses, handling corner cases, and providing more metadata in the
response, like pagination information for long lists of books.
